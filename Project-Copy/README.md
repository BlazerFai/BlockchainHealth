# Decentralized Patient Health Record Management System Using Blockchain Technology

## Overview
This project is a decentralized application (dApp) for secure patient health record management using blockchain. It features:
- React.js frontend (Vite)
- Node.js/Express backend
- Solidity smart contracts for blockchain integration
- Ganache for local blockchain simulation

## Features
- Upload, view, and verify medical records
- Role-based access control (Doctor, Patient, Admin)
- Grant/revoke access to records
- Regulatory functions: thresholds, alerts, access control

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies in each folder (`frontend`, `backend`)
2. Deploy smart contracts using Ganache
3. Start backend and frontend servers

## Folder Structure
- `/frontend` - React app
- `/backend` - Node.js/Express API
- `/contracts` - Solidity smart contracts

## Development Model
Follow an iterative, modular approach. Document all changes and regulatory features.
