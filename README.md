# Decentralized Patient Health Record Management System  
*Built with Blockchain Technology (Hardhat + Solidity + MetaMask)*

## 📖 Overview

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to securely manage and store patient health records on the blockchain. It leverages the immutability and transparency of blockchain to ensure data integrity, patient privacy, and access control — allowing patients and healthcare providers to interact through secure smart contracts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum  
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity  
- **Development Framework**: Hardhat  
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask  
- **Node.js Package Manager**: npm  

## 🚀 Features

- Patients can store and manage their personal health records.
- Healthcare providers can request access to view or update records.
- All transactions are verified through MetaMask.
- Immutable record history — prevents unauthorized changes.
- Decentralized access — no central database.
